"""Reference solution for t013-clear-cache (short). Never shown to the model.

Protocol: turns() is a generator. The driver calls next() for the first turn script and
send(envelope) with each result envelope afterwards. Every yielded string is the body of
exactly one fenced python block; the driver wraps it in a ```python fence and submits it
with `cwr instance turn`. The helpers below run on the driver side only.
